  title: Reworking RRF retriever to be evaluated during rewrite phase
  area: REST API
  details: |-
    In this release (8.16), we have introduced major changes to the retrievers framework and how they can be evaluated,
    focusing mainly on compound retrievers like `rrf` and `text_similarity_reranker`, which allowed us to support
    additional search features like collapsing, explaining, aggregations, and highlighting.
    To ensure consistency and avoid unexpected failures, `rrf` and `text_similarity_reranker` retriever queries are no longer compatible
    with previous releases ( <= 8.15).
    As part of the rework, we have also removed the `_rank` property from the responses of an `rrf` retriever.
  impact: |-
    - Users will not be able to use the `rrf` and `text_similarity_reranker` retrievers in a mixed cluster scenario
    with previous releases (i.e. prior to 8.16), and the request will throw an `IllegalArgumentException`.
    - `_rank` has now been removed from the output of the `rrf` retrievers so trying to directly parse the field
    will throw an exception
