| Stores data and performs CRUD, search, and aggregations. High I/O, CPU, and memory requirements.

| Ingest Node
| ‚õìÔ∏è
| Preprocesses documents before indexing, applying transformations via ingest pipelines like removing fields, enriching data, etc.

| Coordinating Node
| üîÑ
| Handles client requests, routes them to appropriate nodes, gathers and reduces results. Any node can act as a coordinating node.

| Machine Learning Node
