== Elastic Cloud Hot-Frozen Architecture for Time Series Data
++++
<titleabbrev>Architecture: Elastic Cloud hot-frozen</titleabbrev>
++++

The Hot-Frozen Elasticsearch cluster architecture is cost optimized for large time-series datasets while keeping all of the data **fully searchable**. There is no need to "re-hydrate" archived data. In this architecture, the hot tier is primarily used for indexing and immediate searching (1-3 days) with a majority of the search being handled by the frozen tier. Since the data is moved to searchable snapshots in an object store, the cost of keeping all of the data searchable is dramatically reduced.


TIP: This architecture includes all the necessary components of the Elastic Stack and is not intended for sizing workloads, but rather as a basis to ensure the architecture you deploy is foundationally ready to handle any desired workload with resiliency. 

The most important foundational step to any architecture is designing your deployment to be responsive to production workloads. For more information on planning for production, see https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/scalability.html[Get ready for production].

[[cloud-hot-use-case]]
=== Use case

This architecture is intended for organizations that need to do the following:

* Monitor the performance and health of their applications in real time, including the creation and tracking of SLOs (Service Level Objectives).
* Provide insights and alerts to ensure optimal performance and quick issue resolution for applications.
* Apply machine learning and artificial intelligence to assist engineers and application teams in dealing with the large amount of data in this type of use case.

[[cloud-hot-frozen-considerations]]
=== Important considerations

The following list are important conderations for this architecture:

* Frozen tiers are read-only so once data rolls over to the frozen tier, documnets can not longer be updated. If you need to update documents for some part of the data lifecycle, you will need a larger https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/data-tiers.html#hot-tier[hot tier], or introduce a https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/data-tiers.html#warm-tier[warm tier] to cover the time period needed for document updates.
* This architecture leverages a Hot/Frozen architecture. If you require https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/current/about-rules.html[detection rule lookback] or complex dashboards you may need to leverage a https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/data-tiers.html#cold-tier[cold tier].

[[cloud-architecture-limitations]]
=== Limitations of this architecture
* This architecture is a high-availability Elasticsearch architecture. It is not intended as a Disaster Recovery architecture since it is deployed across Availability Zones in a single cloud region. This architecture can be enhanced for Disaster Recovery by adding a second deployment in another cloud region. Details on Disaster Recovery for Elasticsearch can be found at, https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/xpack-ccr.html#ccr-disaster-recovery[disaster recovery].
