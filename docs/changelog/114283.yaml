  title: Remove lenient parsing of bulk actions
  area: 'REST API'
  details: |-
    If a user sends a bulk request with an operation than includes extra fields, the user may assume that 
    the extra fields perform some action, however, in reality they are discarded with a deprecation warning. 
    We remove this leniency and alert the user to their malformed bulk operation.
  impact: |-
    Users that send malformed bulk requests will have those operations rejected with a client error. 
    The user will need to update their client to send the correct bulk operations in order to index documents.
