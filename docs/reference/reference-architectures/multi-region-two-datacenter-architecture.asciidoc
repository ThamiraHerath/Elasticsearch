=== Multi-Region - Two Datacenters

This article defines a scalable and highly available architecture for Elasticsearch using two datacenters in separate geographical regions. 

TIP: This architecture includes all the necessary components of the Elastic Stack and is not intended for sizing workloads, but rather as a basis to ensure the architecture you deploy is foundationally ready to handle any desired workload with resiliency.
