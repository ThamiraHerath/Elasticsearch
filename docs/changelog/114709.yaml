  title: Remove support for wait_for_active_shards=index-setting in index close API
  area: Distributed
  details: |-
    Since 8.0, the default behavior for closing indices has been to wait for the active shards based on the index
    setting. This parameter should no longer be used and is not supported in 9.0.
  impact: |-
    Users that were previously setting `wait_for_active_shards=index-setting` will need to remove the parameter
    in order to close indices.
  notable: false
